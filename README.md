# Variety

Variety is a wallpaper manager for Linux systems. It supports numerous desktops
and a variety of wallpaper sources, including local files and online services
such as Flickr, Wallhaven.cc, NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day, Desktoppr.co,
and media RSS feeds (Picasa, deviantART, etc.).

Variety sits as a tray icon to allow easy pausing and resuming where supported.
It also implements a range of image effects such as oil painting and blur, as
well as layering quotes and a clock onto the background.
