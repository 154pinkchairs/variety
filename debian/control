Description: Changes the desktop wallpaper on a regular basis, using user-specified or automatically downloaded images
 Variety changes the desktop wallpaper on a regular basis, using user-
 specified or automatically downloaded images..Variety sits conveniently
 as an indicator in the panel and can be easily paused and resumed. The
 mouse wheel can be used to scroll wallpapers back and forth until you
 find the perfect one for your current mood..Apart from displaying images
 from local folders, several different online sources can be used to
 fetch wallpapers according to user-specified criteria..Variety can also
 automatically apply various fancy filters to the displayed images -
 charcoal painting, oil painting, heavy blurring, etc. - so that your
 desktop is always fresh and unique.
