# a full ImageMagick command that Variety uses to generate the wallpaper.
# Easiest way to see what's happening is to run variety with -v, enable some filter and enable clock and see
# what ImageMagick command Variety dumps in the log.
#
# The user will want to customize the following aspects:
# fill - color of "filling"
# stroke - color of outline
# strokewidth - width of outline
# font - font to use, run 'convert -list font' to see what font names you can use
# gravity - in which corner to display the clock - SouthEast, NorthEast, SouthWest, NorthWest
# pointsize - defines the font size for the next text to be drawn
# annotate - these must be in the form 0x0+[%HOFFSET+X]+[%VOFFSET+Y], where you can edit X and Y - distance from the screen corner defined by gravity
# The %HOFFSET and %VOFFSET parameters are there for Variety to replace in order to compensate for the diferent dimensions of every image and screen
# The texts can contain these symbols:
# %H - hours (24), %I - hours (12), %p - am or pm, %M - minutes,
# %A - day of week (full), %a - day of week abbreviation, %B - month name, %b - month abbreviation, %d - day of month, %Y - year.
# The full list for these can be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
