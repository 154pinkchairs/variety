Thank you for using Variety Wallpaper Changer.<br>
<br>
If this is the first time you are publishing from Variety, you may have to configure your browser so that it opens
<code>variety://</code> links with Variety.<br>
<br>
Firefox will ask you to choose an application, please choose <code>/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/variety/bin/variety</code> or
<code>/usr/bin/variety</code> - depending on where Variety is installed on your machine.<br>
Make sure to check the option <code>Remember my choice for variety links</code> so you don't have to do this next
time.<br>
<br>
Chrome/Chromium will ask you to open the link with <code>xdg-open</code>, which would itself launch Variety, as it is
registered as a handler for <code>variety://</code> links.<br>
Check the option <code>Remember my choice for all links of this type</code> and click <code>Launch
    Application</code>.<br>
<br>
For other browsers the procedure is similar, but you may have to ask Google.<br>
<br>
