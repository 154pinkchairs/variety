# This script is run by Variety when a new wallpaper is set.
# The first passed parameter (accessed with $1) is the absolute path to the wallpaper.
# The second passed parameter ($2) is "auto" when the wallpaper is changed automatically (i.e. regular change)
# and "manual" otherwise - e.g. when the user clicks Previous, Next or Trash.
# You can use bash, python or whatever suits you for the script.
# Here you can put custom commands for setting the wallpaper on your specifc desktop environment
# or run commands like notify-send to notify you of the change, or you can
# run commands that would theme your browser, login screen or whatever you desire.

# Below you will find some examples:

# Gnome 3, Unity
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri "file://$1"

# XFCE
# xfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p /backdrop/screen0/monitor0/image-path -s "$1"

# Show a notification on wallpaper change (only when the change is automatic)
# name=$(echo "$1" | sed 's/\//\n/g'| tail -n 1)
# if [ "$2" == "auto" ]; then notify-send --icon "$1" "Wallpaper changed" "$name" ; fi
