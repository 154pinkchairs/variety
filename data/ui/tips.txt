You can change the wallpaper back and forth by scrolling the mouse wheel on top of the indicator icon.

When the launcher icon is visible (no matter if locked there or not) you can drop image links or files on top of it to download them and use them as wallpapers.

To show the launcher icon in order to lock it or use it for dropping links, you can always click About or Preferences.

Adding your own custom filters is quite easy: open ~/.config/variety/variety.conf in an editor and use the existing filters as an example. Every filter is just a line of options to be passed to ImageMagick's convert command.

The indicator has keyboard shortcuts for some of the actions - e.g. show indicator, then press F to copy to favorites, or T to move to Trash. This can speed up cleanup tasks.

When you select an image source, its images are displayed in a window at the bottom of the screen. Click an image there to set is as wallpaper. You can also right-click this window to close it or pin it so that it stays even after you close the Preferences dialog.

You can select multiple image sources to create a "merged" thumbnail view of all of them. Please mind that thumbnail view is limited to several hundred randomly selected images.

Automatic downloading of images happens only if you have turned on downloading AND have some online image source enabled.

Color and size options will be ignored if there are too few matching images. The color options are still experimental, so don't be surprised if they work somewhat strange.
